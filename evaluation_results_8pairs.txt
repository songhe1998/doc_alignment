üí¨ KEY EVALUATION INSIGHTS:
==========================

ü•á BEST PERFORMANCE (Pair 3 - 8.8/10):
"Strong section alignment accuracy with all 35 document sections aligned. 
High confidence matches with robust content comparison. Minor gaps in 
template coverage but overall excellent performance."

üìä AVERAGE PERFORMANCE (Pair 6 - 6.3/10):
"Good alignment accuracy for similar topics but limited coverage (only 12/48 
sections aligned). Content comparison shows room for improvement in detecting 
finer nuances."

üìâ ISSUES IDENTIFIED (Pair 7 - 0.0/10):
"Complete failure with zero sections detected. System needs robust document 
parsing and error handling for edge cases."

üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================
1. CRITICAL: Improve section alignment logic (accuracy below 7.0)
2. CRITICAL: Enhance content comparison prompts (quality below 7.0)  
3. HIGH: Work on coverage completeness (below 7.0)
4. MEDIUM: Add better error handling for failed parsing cases
5. LOW: Optimize processing time (currently ~2min per pair)

SYSTEM STATUS: Needs significant improvements across all metrics
PRIORITY: Focus on section parsing and alignment accuracy first
