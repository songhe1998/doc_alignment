## 🔄 Comparison with Original

| Feature | Original | Improved |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Layout | Single column | Side-by-side |
| Visualization | Plain text cards | Color-coded highlights |
| Interactivity | None | Click to focus |
| Navigation | Scroll only | Legend + Click + Scroll |
| Visual Connection | None | Shared colors |
| Document View | Summarized | Full text with highlights |

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Faster comprehension**: Colors show relationships instantly
2. **Better navigation**: Click anywhere to focus
3. **Complete view**: See full documents, not just summaries
4. **Professional appearance**: Modern, polished UI
5. **User-friendly**: Intuitive interactions

## 🐛 Debugging

If colors don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors

## 📝 Notes

- Colors are assigned sequentially and wrap after 20 alignments
- Longer documents may have truncated highlights for performance
- Topic-based methods show sections in colored blocks
- Section-based methods highlight inline text

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Export colored comparison to PDF
- Custom color schemes
- Zoom controls for document panels
- Search within documents
- More alignment methods
- Collaborative annotations
