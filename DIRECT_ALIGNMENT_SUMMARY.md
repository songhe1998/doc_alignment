|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Standard Topics** | 15 predefined topics | No predefined topics |
| **Topics Found** | 3 in both, 7 only in NDA 2 | 4 in both, 1 in NDA 1, 4 in NDA 2 |
| **Coverage Analysis** | 20% of standard topics | 100% of actual topics |
| **Gap Detection** | Shows missing standard clauses | Shows unique document topics |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed template | Adapts to document |
| **Comparison Basis** | Against ideal NDA | Against each other |
| **Best For** | Compliance checking | Direct comparison |

"What topics does their NDA cover that ours doesn't?"
→ Identifies unique clauses quickly
→ Reveals negotiation points
```

**Document Evolution:**
```
"How has our NDA changed from v1 to v2?"
