- Shows content differences
- Fast processing (~10-20 seconds)

**2. Topic-Based (Template)** 📚
- Identifies document type automatically
- Uses 15 standard legal topics
- Shows compliance gaps
- Comprehensive analysis (~30-40 seconds)

**3. Topic-Based (Direct)** 🎯
- No templates needed
- Extracts topics from each document
- Semantic matching
- Flexible and adaptive (~25-35 seconds)

### User Interface

✨ **Beautiful Design:**
- Gradient purple theme
- Card-based layout
- Responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Loading indicators
- Error handling

📤 **File Upload:**
- Supports PDF and TXT
- 16MB max file size

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)

```python
app.py
├── / (GET) → Render homepage
├── /align (POST) → Process documents
│   ├── section_based_alignment()
│   ├── topic_template_alignment()
│   └── topic_direct_alignment()
└── /static/<file> → Serve CSS/JS
```

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

```
templates/index.html
├── Upload Section
│   ├── File Input 1
│   ├── File Input 2
│   └── Method Selection (3 radio buttons)
├── Results Section (hidden initially)
│   ├── Summary Statistics
│   └── Alignment Cards
└── Footer Info
```

### Data Flow

```
User Upload → Flask Backend → Extract Text → 
Choose Method → Call OpenAI API → Process Results →
Format JSON → Send to Frontend → Display Results
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not configured"**
```bash
# Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

**"File too large"**
- Max size: 16MB
- Solution: Compress or split document

**"Error extracting PDF"**
- PDF must have selectable text
- Scanned images won't work
- Try converting to TXT first

**Slow processing**
- Normal: 10-60 seconds
- Large docs take longer
- Template method slowest
