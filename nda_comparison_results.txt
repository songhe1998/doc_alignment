Comparison:
NDA 1 provides a detailed definition of 'Confidential Information' by listing specific types of information, such as Critical Infrastructure Information and Protected Health Information, thereby offering a clear scope of what is considered confidential. In contrast, NDA 2 offers a more general definition, focusing on the intent of the Discloser and the specific purpose of sharing the information, which may leave room for broader interpretation.

In contrast, NDA 2 provides a broader clause allowing disclosure of confidential information if required by law or a competent authority, without specifying particular types of information or legal frameworks.
