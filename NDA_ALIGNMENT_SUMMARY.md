### **NDA 1 (JEA)** 
- ✅ **Strengths**: Highly detailed definitions, specific legal compliance (Florida Sunshine Law), comprehensive information categories
- ⚠️  **Concerns**: Missing standard clauses like return of information, explicit term duration, governing law
- 📝 **Nature**: Government/public utility focused with emphasis on regulatory compliance (NERC CIP, HIPAA, FCRA)

### **NDA 2 (Frodsham Town Council)**
- ✅ **Strengths**: Complete standard NDA structure, clear obligations, explicit terms, governing law
- ⚠️  **Concerns**: Very brief, less detailed definitions, minimal examples of confidential information
- 📝 **Nature**: Simple, standard NDA template suitable for general business purposes

## 🎓 Methodology: Topic-Based Alignment

Unlike traditional section-by-section alignment, this approach:

1. ✅ **Identifies document type** → "Non-Disclosure Agreement" (high confidence)
2. ✅ **Researches standard topics** → 15 typical NDA topics
3. ✅ **Extracts topics from each document** → Using LLM to understand content semantically
4. ✅ **Aligns by conceptual topics** → Not dependent on section numbering
5. ✅ **Compares content** → Highlights substantive differences

**Advantages**:
- Works with documents of different lengths (2,484 vs 395 words)
- Handles different structures (12 vs 9 sections)
- Semantic understanding (knows what topics *should* exist)
- Identifies missing essential clauses

## 💡 Recommendations

### For NDA 1 (JEA)
1. ⚠️  **Add explicit term/duration clause** (currently vague)
2. ⚠️  **Include return/destruction requirements** (missing)
3. ⚠️  **Clarify governing law** (mentions Florida but no explicit clause)
4. ✅ **Consider recipient obligations section** (currently distributed)

### For NDA 2 (Frodsham)
1. ⚠️  **Expand definitions section** (too brief)
2. ⚠️  **Add specific examples** of confidential information
3. ⚠️  **Include remedies for breach** (consequences unclear)
4. ✅ **Consider purpose-specific provisions** if needed

### General Observations
- **NDA 1** is compliance-focused but structurally incomplete
- **NDA 2** is structurally complete but content-light
- **Neither** includes non-compete/non-solicitation (acceptable for basic NDAs)
